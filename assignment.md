> I will note that the main technologies at Thanx are React for the front-end, Ruby on Rails for the backend, and MySQL for the database. For ease of evaluation, please limit your submission with Ruby on Rails on backend and Javascript/React for frontend (Ruby: 3.4.3, Rails 8.02, React >16). SQLite is preferred as db.
